# Aurabot state calculator

You can find a link to a live version of app at [Here](https://hepnuk.github.io/aurastatcalc/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes :

- This is a passion project to help me learn react and javascript more detail. 

- The code is messy and can be improved, will work on that once I have finished all the functionalities.

- The current styling is temporary and will work more on it once app is finished.
