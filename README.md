# Aurabot stat calculator

You can find a link to the live version of app at [Here](https://hepnuk.github.io/aurastatcalc/) ..Still a WIP

### What is this?

This is an app I made to compliment the AuraCalc made by Mikelat and updated me found [Here](https://github.com/HepNuk/AuraCalc), live version [Here](https://hepnuk.github.io/AuraCalc/)

This app allows a user to input diffrent settings matching his Gear/PassiveTree/Ascendancy/ClusterJewels/etc. which is then taken to calculate and output (in real time) all the states this aurabot provides. You can then copy to clipboard the data and paste it in [Path of Building](https://pathofbuilding.community/) as a Jewel and see a given carries damage with said aurabot. 

## Notes :

- This is a passion project to help me learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) and Javascript more detail (as well as CSS/HTML). 

- This is also to ease my and every other aurabot's time calculating how much damage they provide as well as an easier way to min max gear.

- The code is messy and can be improved and less cluttered, will work on that once I have finished all the functionalities.

- The current styling is temporary and I will work more on it once the app is fully functional.
