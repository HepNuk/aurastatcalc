# Aurabot state calculator

You can find a link to the live version of app at [Here](https://hepnuk.github.io/aurastatcalc/) ..Still a WIP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

This is an app I made to compliment the AuraCalc made by Mikelat and updated me found [Here](https://github.com/HepNuk/AuraCalc), live version [Here](https://hepnuk.github.io/AuraCalc/)

This app allows a user to input diffrent settings matching his Gear/PassiveTree/Ascendancy/ClusterJewels/etc. which is then taken to calculate and output (in real time) all the states this aurabot provides. You can then copy to clipboard the data and paste it in [Path of Building](https://pathofbuilding.community/) as a Jewel and see a given carries damage with said aurabot. 

## Notes :

- This is a passion project to help me learn react and javascript more detail. 

- The code is messy and can be improved, will work on that once I have finished all the functionalities.

- The current styling is temporary and will work more on it once app is finished.
